My latest working kpu situng scraper is 'newScrape-v2.1-NightBuild.py', (it's) sufficient enough to pull C1-PPWPs and summary every TPS, with condition fast and stable connection.

This scraper needs webdriver (chrome) and some modules to works. In addition to download C1-PPWPs, we need to use 'c.pem' as reliable SSL certificate because requests(module) couldn't get an access without it.

The results will be stored in 'hasil' folder and if an error occurred, program will add a log in 'error' folder.

And the last but very important, 'watcher.py' is a watch dog that keeps 'newScrape-v2.1-NightBuild.py' running.

Note: the scripts may be personal, please take a look on inputs and outputs before run the scripts!
